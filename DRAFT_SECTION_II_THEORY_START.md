## II.A. Memes and Institutions: From Dennett to North (2 pages)

### The Extended Phenotype Applied to Law

Richard Dawkins (1982) introduced the concept of the extended phenotype: genes produce effects beyond the organism's body. A beaver's dam, a bird's nest, a spider's web—these are phenotypic expressions of genetic information projected into the environment. The dam is as much part of the beaver's phenotype as its teeth or tail. This insight revolutionized evolutionary biology by showing that selection acts on genes' *effects*, wherever those effects manifest, not merely on organisms' physical traits.

Daniel Dennett (2017) extended this logic to cultural evolution. Memes—units of cultural information—operate analogously to genes. They replicate, vary, and face selection pressures. But crucially, Dennett argues that **the most powerful memes are unconscious**: they operate "below the level of conscious awareness," shaping behavior without actors recognizing them as contingent cultural constructions. Just as speakers follow grammatical rules without studying linguistics, individuals follow cultural scripts without recognizing them as learned rather than natural.

This insight transforms how I understand legal institutions. **Legal rules are memetic extended phenotypes**—visible structures (like beaver dams) produced by invisible cultural replication machinery (like genetic code). Constitutional provisions about labor rights, judicial doctrines about *ultra-activity*, legislative procedures for reform—these are the *dams*. The cultural consensus that makes questioning these arrangements unthinkable is the *genetic code*. Reformers who attack the dam without understanding the DNA that builds it are condemned to fail.

Consider Argentina's Article 14 bis (1949 constitutional labor rights). Conventional analysis treats this as a formal legal constraint: amending requires two-thirds congressional support plus ratification, creating high barriers. But this explains neither why amendment has never been seriously attempted (23 reforms bypassed amendment route), nor why reforms that preserve Article 14 bis while enabling flexibility also fail. The puzzle deepens when noting that Brazil's Article 7 (analogous labor rights) has been effectively modified through "constitutional mutations" accepted by courts despite similar amendment barriers (Lerer 2024).

The difference is memetic, not formal. Argentine political discourse treats labor rights as **sacrosanct**—a term that literally means "set apart, untouchable." Proposals to reform labor law trigger moral language: "attacks on acquired rights" (*derechos adquiridos*), "assault on worker dignity," "surrender to neoliberalism." This is not strategic rhetoric; it reflects genuine belief that certain institutional arrangements embody fundamental values not subject to utilitarian trade-offs. When President Macri (2015-2019) proposed eliminating *ultra-activity* (collective bargaining agreements remain valid indefinitely even after expiration), he faced accusations of "destroying 70 years of social progress"—not from unions alone but from centrist and even some center-right politicians.

This is unconscious memetic replication. Political actors defend these arrangements *without recognizing* they are constrained by cultural scripts. They experience their position as moral conviction rather than learned preference. Survey them and they report sincere belief in labor protections' necessity. But the *origin* of that belief—decades of cultural transmission through legal education, political socialization, media framing—remains opaque to conscious reflection. As Dennett emphasizes, unconscious memes are most effective precisely because they seem natural rather than cultural.

### Douglass North's Institutional Framework: Formal vs. Informal Constraints

Douglass North (1990, 1991) distinguished between formal and informal institutional constraints:

**Formal constraints:** Written rules—constitutions, statutes, regulations, contracts. These are consciously designed, explicitly codified, and enforced through official sanctions (courts, police, administrative agencies).

**Informal constraints:** Unwritten norms—customs, traditions, codes of conduct, taboos. These are culturally transmitted, implicitly understood, and enforced through social sanctions (ostracism, reputation damage, moral condemnation).

North's crucial insight: **informal constraints often bind more powerfully than formal rules**. Violating a law risks legal penalty (fines, imprisonment); violating a deep cultural norm risks social death. Moreover, informal norms have higher "enforcement efficiency"—every member of society becomes a potential enforcer through social sanctioning, whereas formal law requires costly institutional apparatus (police, courts, prisons).

North illustrated this with post-Communist transitions. Russia and Poland both adopted formal democratic institutions (elections, parliaments, independent courts) in the 1990s. Yet governance outcomes diverged dramatically. Poland developed functioning democratic competition; Russia retained authoritarian tendencies despite constitutional protections. The difference lay in informal norms: Poland had cultural memory of pre-Communist civic pluralism, Russia did not. Formal institutions without supporting informal norms produced "façade democracies."

Applied to labor law: Argentina's formal labor code (Ley de Contrato de Trabajo 20.744) is detailed, comprehensive, and rigid. But many provisions are routinely violated in practice—employment informality reaches 35-40%. So formal law is not consistently enforced. What *is* enforced is the informal norm that **formal attempts to change the code are illegitimate**. Governments can tolerate informal flexibility (off-the-books employment) but cannot formally legislate it without facing social mobilization. This is the opposite of rule-of-law logic: informal violations are accepted; formal reforms are blocked.

North's framework helps explain Argentina but leaves a gap: **How do informal norms become rigid?** North treats informal constraints as evolving slowly through cultural adaptation, but provides no theory of why some norms remain flexible (subject to gradual change) while others become "petrified" (resistant to change even when maladaptive). This is where memetics adds value.

### Integration: Memetic Replication Dynamics Explain Informal Rigidity

Combining Dennett and North, I propose that **institutional lock-in arises when unconscious memetic replication produces informal norms that constrain formal rule-making**.

The causal chain:

1. **Cultural transmission** (families, schools, media, legal education) replicates memes about labor rights, social justice, state obligations
2. **Unconscious internalization** makes these memes seem natural rather than contingent
3. **Informal norms** emerge: actors feel moral obligation to defend inherited arrangements
4. **Social sanctioning** punishes those who question taboos (reputation attacks, moral condemnation)
5. **Formal constraint** results: political actors self-censor, reforms never reach agenda, proposals that do arise are defeated through mobilization

This explains three puzzles:

**Puzzle 1: Why do stated preferences diverge from behavioral patterns?** 
Survey respondents consciously report wanting labor flexibility (71% support), but their *unconscious* commitment to inherited norms makes them resist concrete reforms. This is not hypocrisy—actors genuinely don't recognize the contradiction because the norms operate below awareness.

**Puzzle 2: Why do reforms fail despite institutional capacity?**
Unified governments with veto-player majorities fail to reform because informal social sanctions create *reputational costs* that outweigh formal institutional capacity. Macri had legislative votes for labor reform but faced general strikes that threatened political survival.

**Puzzle 3: Why are some institutions "sacred" while others are pragmatic?**
Memetic replication is uneven. Some institutions (tax policy, infrastructure) remain subject to utilitarian calculation. Others (labor rights, acquired social benefits) become culturally "sacred"—set apart from cost-benefit analysis. This reflects historical contingency in which memes replicated successfully (Argentina's labor memes trace to Peronist origins + trade union cultural power) rather than logical necessity.

**Table 3: Conceptual Mapping Dennett-North-CLI**

| Dennett Concept | North Concept | CLI_cultural Indicator |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Meme replication fitness | Institutional persistence | CT1 (narrative stability) |
| Selection pressure | Social sanctions | CT2 (shock resistance) |
| Extended phenotype | Informal constraints | CT3 (policy continuity) |
| Unconscious transmission | Taken-for-granted rules | Cultural taboos |
| Conscious memes (weak) | Explicit attitudes | Survey responses |
| Unconscious memes (strong) | Implicit consensus | Behavioral patterns |

### Critical Distinction: Explicit vs. Implicit Memes

This framework requires distinguishing two forms of memetic capture:

**Explicit memes:** Consciously held beliefs, accessible via introspection and reportable in surveys. Actors *know* they hold these views and can articulate reasons. Example: "I support worker protections because inequality is unjust." This is what conventional public opinion research measures and what the original CLI_mem component (Lerer 2024) captured via World Values Survey / Latinobarómetro.

**Implicit memes:** Unconsciously replicated patterns, observable only through behavior not introspection. Actors follow these cultural scripts without recognizing them as contingent choices—they seem "natural," "obvious," "fundamental." Example: Political actors across ideologies converge on defending *ultra-activity* without recognizing this as learned preference rather than logical necessity. This is what CLI_cultural measures through behavioral indicators.

The gap between explicit and implicit memes explains Argentina's paradox. Argentines *explicitly* support labor flexibility (71% in surveys) while *implicitly* defending rigidity (behavioral opposition to every reform attempt). This is not contradiction but layering: conscious attitudes formed through rational reflection coexist with unconscious commitments formed through cultural transmission. When the two conflict, the unconscious often wins—actors find reasons to oppose concrete reforms they abstractly support.

This has profound implications for democratic theory. If the "will of the people" divides into explicit preferences (surveys) and implicit constraints (behaviors), which reflects authentic democratic choice? Rousseau's distinction between "will of all" (aggregate preferences) and "general will" (common good) takes on new meaning: perhaps the general will manifests not in what people *say* they want but in what cultural patterns *allow* them to choose. Section V returns to this normative question.

## II.B. Triple Lock Framework: Expanding the CLI Model (2 pages)

**[TO BE DRAFTED - Will include:]**

- Original CLI formula: CLI_total = 0.15·CLI_mem + 0.40·CLI_corp + 0.25·CLI_olig + 0.20·CONST
- Problem: CLI_mem based on surveys (Argentina scores LOW 0.203) despite extreme rigidity
- Diagnosis: Surveys capture explicit attitudes, miss implicit consensus
- Solution: Replace CLI_mem with CLI_cultural (behavioral measures)
- Revised formula: CLI_total_revised = 0.25·CLI_cultural + 0.35·CLI_corp + 0.25·CLI_olig + 0.15·CONST
- Justification for weight adjustment (CLI_cultural increases, CLI_corp decreases because corporate power partially reflects cultural consensus)
- Table 4: Comparative predictions showing revised model improves fit
- Correlation improvement: r = 0.67 → r = 0.89 (R² improvement: 0.45 → 0.79)
