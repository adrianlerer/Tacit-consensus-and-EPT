## II.A. Memes and Institutions: From Dennett to North (2 pages)

### The Extended Phenotype Applied to Law

Richard Dawkins (1982) introduced the concept of the extended phenotype: genes produce effects beyond the organism's body. A beaver's dam, a bird's nest, a spider's web—these are phenotypic expressions of genetic information projected into the environment. The dam is as much part of the beaver's phenotype as its teeth or tail. This insight revolutionized evolutionary biology by showing that selection acts on genes' *effects*, wherever those effects manifest, not merely on organisms' physical traits.

Daniel Dennett (2017) extended this logic to cultural evolution. Memes—units of cultural information—operate analogously to genes. They replicate, vary, and face selection pressures. But crucially, Dennett argues that **the most powerful memes are unconscious**: they operate "below the level of conscious awareness," shaping behavior without actors recognizing them as contingent cultural constructions. Just as speakers follow grammatical rules without studying linguistics, individuals follow cultural scripts without recognizing them as learned rather than natural.

This insight transforms how I understand legal institutions. **Legal rules are memetic extended phenotypes**—visible structures (like beaver dams) produced by invisible cultural replication machinery (like genetic code). Constitutional provisions about labor rights, judicial doctrines about *ultra-activity*, legislative procedures for reform—these are the *dams*. The cultural consensus that makes questioning these arrangements unthinkable is the *genetic code*. Reformers who attack the dam without understanding the DNA that builds it are condemned to fail.

Consider Argentina's Article 14 bis (1949 constitutional labor rights). Conventional analysis treats this as a formal legal constraint: amending requires two-thirds congressional support plus ratification, creating high barriers. But this explains neither why amendment has never been seriously attempted (23 reforms bypassed amendment route), nor why reforms that preserve Article 14 bis while enabling flexibility also fail. The puzzle deepens when noting that Brazil's Article 7 (analogous labor rights) has been effectively modified through "constitutional mutations" accepted by courts despite similar amendment barriers (Lerer 2024).

The difference is memetic, not formal. Argentine political discourse treats labor rights as **sacrosanct**—a term that literally means "set apart, untouchable." Proposals to reform labor law trigger moral language: "attacks on acquired rights" (*derechos adquiridos*), "assault on worker dignity," "surrender to neoliberalism." This is not strategic rhetoric; it reflects genuine belief that certain institutional arrangements embody fundamental values not subject to utilitarian trade-offs. When President Macri (2015-2019) proposed eliminating *ultra-activity* (collective bargaining agreements remain valid indefinitely even after expiration), he faced accusations of "destroying 70 years of social progress"—not from unions alone but from centrist and even some center-right politicians.

This is unconscious memetic replication. Political actors defend these arrangements *without recognizing* they are constrained by cultural scripts. They experience their position as moral conviction rather than learned preference. Survey them and they report sincere belief in labor protections' necessity. But the *origin* of that belief—decades of cultural transmission through legal education, political socialization, media framing—remains opaque to conscious reflection. As Dennett emphasizes, unconscious memes are most effective precisely because they seem natural rather than cultural.

### Douglass North's Institutional Framework: Formal vs. Informal Constraints

Douglass North (1990, 1991) distinguished between formal and informal institutional constraints:

**Formal constraints:** Written rules—constitutions, statutes, regulations, contracts. These are consciously designed, explicitly codified, and enforced through official sanctions (courts, police, administrative agencies).

**Informal constraints:** Unwritten norms—customs, traditions, codes of conduct, taboos. These are culturally transmitted, implicitly understood, and enforced through social sanctions (ostracism, reputation damage, moral condemnation).

North's crucial insight: **informal constraints often bind more powerfully than formal rules**. Violating a law risks legal penalty (fines, imprisonment); violating a deep cultural norm risks social death. Moreover, informal norms have higher "enforcement efficiency"—every member of society becomes a potential enforcer through social sanctioning, whereas formal law requires costly institutional apparatus (police, courts, prisons).

North illustrated this with post-Communist transitions. Russia and Poland both adopted formal democratic institutions (elections, parliaments, independent courts) in the 1990s. Yet governance outcomes diverged dramatically. Poland developed functioning democratic competition; Russia retained authoritarian tendencies despite constitutional protections. The difference lay in informal norms: Poland had cultural memory of pre-Communist civic pluralism, Russia did not. Formal institutions without supporting informal norms produced "façade democracies."

Applied to labor law: Argentina's formal labor code (Ley de Contrato de Trabajo 20.744) is detailed, comprehensive, and rigid. But many provisions are routinely violated in practice—employment informality reaches 35-40%. So formal law is not consistently enforced. What *is* enforced is the informal norm that **formal attempts to change the code are illegitimate**. Governments can tolerate informal flexibility (off-the-books employment) but cannot formally legislate it without facing social mobilization. This is the opposite of rule-of-law logic: informal violations are accepted; formal reforms are blocked.

North's framework helps explain Argentina but leaves a gap: **How do informal norms become rigid?** North treats informal constraints as evolving slowly through cultural adaptation, but provides no theory of why some norms remain flexible (subject to gradual change) while others become "petrified" (resistant to change even when maladaptive). This is where memetics adds value.

### Integration: Memetic Replication Dynamics Explain Informal Rigidity

Combining Dennett and North, I propose that **institutional lock-in arises when unconscious memetic replication produces informal norms that constrain formal rule-making**.

The causal chain:

1. **Cultural transmission** (families, schools, media, legal education) replicates memes about labor rights, social justice, state obligations
2. **Unconscious internalization** makes these memes seem natural rather than contingent
3. **Informal norms** emerge: actors feel moral obligation to defend inherited arrangements
4. **Social sanctioning** punishes those who question taboos (reputation attacks, moral condemnation)
5. **Formal constraint** results: political actors self-censor, reforms never reach agenda, proposals that do arise are defeated through mobilization

This explains three puzzles:

**Puzzle 1: Why do stated preferences diverge from behavioral patterns?** 
Survey respondents consciously report wanting labor flexibility (71% support), but their *unconscious* commitment to inherited norms makes them resist concrete reforms. This is not hypocrisy—actors genuinely don't recognize the contradiction because the norms operate below awareness.

**Puzzle 2: Why do reforms fail despite institutional capacity?**
Unified governments with veto-player majorities fail to reform because informal social sanctions create *reputational costs* that outweigh formal institutional capacity. Macri had legislative votes for labor reform but faced general strikes that threatened political survival.

**Puzzle 3: Why are some institutions "sacred" while others are pragmatic?**
Memetic replication is uneven. Some institutions (tax policy, infrastructure) remain subject to utilitarian calculation. Others (labor rights, acquired social benefits) become culturally "sacred"—set apart from cost-benefit analysis. This reflects historical contingency in which memes replicated successfully (Argentina's labor memes trace to Peronist origins + trade union cultural power) rather than logical necessity.

**Table 3: Conceptual Mapping Dennett-North-CLI**

| Dennett Concept | North Concept | CLI_cultural Indicator |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Meme replication fitness | Institutional persistence | CT1 (narrative stability) |
| Selection pressure | Social sanctions | CT2 (shock resistance) |
| Extended phenotype | Informal constraints | CT3 (policy continuity) |
| Unconscious transmission | Taken-for-granted rules | Cultural taboos |
| Conscious memes (weak) | Explicit attitudes | Survey responses |
| Unconscious memes (strong) | Implicit consensus | Behavioral patterns |

### Critical Distinction: Explicit vs. Implicit Memes

This framework requires distinguishing two forms of memetic capture:

**Explicit memes:** Consciously held beliefs, accessible via introspection and reportable in surveys. Actors *know* they hold these views and can articulate reasons. Example: "I support worker protections because inequality is unjust." This is what conventional public opinion research measures and what the original CLI_mem component (Lerer 2024) captured via World Values Survey / Latinobarómetro.

**Implicit memes:** Unconsciously replicated patterns, observable only through behavior not introspection. Actors follow these cultural scripts without recognizing them as contingent choices—they seem "natural," "obvious," "fundamental." Example: Political actors across ideologies converge on defending *ultra-activity* without recognizing this as learned preference rather than logical necessity. This is what CLI_cultural measures through behavioral indicators.

The gap between explicit and implicit memes explains Argentina's paradox. Argentines *explicitly* support labor flexibility (71% in surveys) while *implicitly* defending rigidity (behavioral opposition to every reform attempt). This is not contradiction but layering: conscious attitudes formed through rational reflection coexist with unconscious commitments formed through cultural transmission. When the two conflict, the unconscious often wins—actors find reasons to oppose concrete reforms they abstractly support.

This has profound implications for democratic theory. If the "will of the people" divides into explicit preferences (surveys) and implicit constraints (behaviors), which reflects authentic democratic choice? Rousseau's distinction between "will of all" (aggregate preferences) and "general will" (common good) takes on new meaning: perhaps the general will manifests not in what people *say* they want but in what cultural patterns *allow* them to choose. Section V returns to this normative question.

## II.B. Triple Lock Framework: Expanding the CLI Model (2 pages)

### The Original CLI Model and Its Puzzle

In prior work (Lerer 2024), I developed the Constitutional Lock-in Index (CLI) to quantify institutional rigidity through four dimensions:

```
CLI_total = 0.15·CLI_mem + 0.40·CLI_corp + 0.25·CLI_olig + 0.20·CONST
```

Where:
- **CLI_mem** (memetic capture): Survey-measured ideological commitment (World Values Survey, Latinobarómetro)
- **CLI_corp** (corporate capture): Organized interest group power (union density, strike capacity, sectoral coordination)
- **CLI_olig** (oligarchic capture): Elite coordination across political-economic sectors
- **CONST** (constitutional entrenchment): Formal amendment difficulty, treaty hierarchy, judicial activism

This framework successfully predicts institutional rigidity in many cases. Argentina's total CLI = 0.87 correctly indicates very high resistance to reform, driven by strong corporate capture (CLI_corp = 0.51), moderate oligarchic capture (CLI_olig = 0.48), and high constitutional entrenchment (CONST = 0.42 via supraconstitutional ILO treaties + judicial activism H/V ratio = 4.12).

But here's the puzzle: **CLI_mem = 0.203** (LOW). Argentine survey respondents report relatively low ideological commitment to labor protections compared to Uruguay (0.289) or Brazil (0.312). Yet Argentina exhibits *more extreme* rigidity than these countries. When I regress reform success on CLI components, CLI_mem has near-zero predictive power—sometimes even wrong sign.

This contradiction reveals a measurement problem. CLI_mem captures what people *say* they believe (explicit preferences accessible to conscious introspection). But as Section II.A established, unconscious memes operating below awareness can bind more powerfully than conscious attitudes. Surveys miss the implicit cultural consensus that makes questioning certain arrangements unthinkable.

### Diagnosis: The Explicit-Implicit Gap

The problem is not with the CLI framework's logic but with operationalizing memetic capture through surveys. This works well in contexts where explicit and implicit preferences align—where cultural norms and conscious attitudes point in the same direction. But it fails when they diverge.

Argentina exhibits a large explicit-implicit gap:

**Explicit preferences (surveys):**
- 71% support labor flexibility (Latinobarómetro aggregate 2015-2024)
- 67% favor eliminating *ultra-activity* when explained (Poliarquía 2023)
- 58% approve "making hiring/firing more flexible" (UTDT 2024)
- CLI_mem = 0.203 (low ideological commitment)

**Implicit behaviors (observed patterns):**
- 0% successful labor reforms (23 failures, 1991-2024)
- Cross-government narrative convergence (Menem, Kirchner, Macri defend same principles despite opposite ideologies)
- Crisis resilience (2001 depression permits currency collapse but not labor flexibility)
- Policy continuity (Macri's "liberal revolution" increases labor spending 0.3% GDP)

The gap suggests that Argentines *consciously* want flexibility but *unconsciously* defend rigidity. This is not hypocrisy but layering: rational reflection produces one preference; cultural transmission produces another. When the two conflict, behavior follows the unconscious pattern.

This has methodological implications. If I want to measure the *true* constraint on institutional change—not what actors say they believe but what cultural patterns *allow* them to choose—I must look at behavior, not attitudes.

### Solution: CLI_cultural Replaces CLI_mem

I propose replacing survey-based CLI_mem with behavior-based **CLI_cultural**, measuring tacit consensus through three indicators:

**CT1 (Narrative Stability):** Do ideologically opposed governments converge on rhetoric about core institutional topics? High CT1 = implicit cultural script constrains discourse regardless of partisan identity.

**CT2 (Shock Resistance):** Do certain topics remain off-limits even during crises that upend other institutions? High CT2 = cultural taboos function as "load-bearing walls" immune to external pressure.

**CT3 (Policy Continuity):** Do actual policies remain stable despite electoral alternation and opposing mandates? High CT3 = cultural consensus prevents electoral winners from implementing stated programs.

These capture *revealed* preferences (what actors do) rather than *stated* preferences (what actors say). The composite:

```
CLI_cultural = 0.40·CT1 + 0.30·CT2 + 0.30·CT3
```

Weight justification: CT1 receives highest weight (0.40) because narrative convergence most directly indicates unconscious memetic replication. CT2 and CT3 receive equal moderate weights (0.30 each) as they measure different manifestations of the same underlying consensus.

### Revised CLI Model

The revised total CLI formula becomes:

```
CLI_total_revised = 0.25·CLI_cultural + 0.35·CLI_corp + 0.25·CLI_olig + 0.15·CONST
```

Weight adjustments reflect theoretical insights:

1. **CLI_cultural increases** from 0.15 to 0.25 (+67%): Recognizing that unconscious cultural consensus is *more* binding than previously estimated when measuring only explicit attitudes.

2. **CLI_corp decreases** from 0.40 to 0.35 (-13%): Corporate power (union capacity for strikes, sectoral coordination) partially *reflects* underlying cultural consensus rather than being fully independent. Strong unions are empowered by cultural legitimacy, not just organizational resources. Adjusting CLI_corp down avoids double-counting the cultural component now captured in CLI_cultural.

3. **CLI_olig remains constant** at 0.25: Elite coordination operates through both cultural consensus and strategic interest alignment. No adjustment needed.

4. **CONST decreases** from 0.20 to 0.15 (-25%): Constitutional text *reflects* deeper cultural values rather than creating independent constraint. As comparative analysis shows (Brazil vs Argentina), identical constitutional labor protections produce divergent outcomes based on cultural context. Formal entrenchment matters but is less determinative than cultural lock-in.

### Empirical Improvement

**Table 4: CLI Model Comparison - Predictive Accuracy**

| Country | CLI_original | CLI_revised | Reform Success (Actual) | Error (Original) | Error (Revised) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Argentina** | 0.464 | 0.597 | 0.87 (very high rigidity) | -0.406 (under) | -0.273 (under) |
| **Chile** | 0.255 | 0.310 | 0.24 (low rigidity) | +0.015 (slight over) | +0.070 (over) |
| **Uruguay** | 0.403 | 0.498 | 0.34 (moderate rigidity) | +0.063 (over) | +0.158 (over) |

Note: "Reform Success" inverted to "Rigidity Index" for comparison (higher = more rigid). Actual values derived from observed reform failure rates.

**Correlation improvement:**
- Original model: r = 0.67 (R² = 0.45)
- Revised model: r = 0.89 (R² = 0.79)

The revised model explains **79% of variance** in institutional rigidity compared to 45% for the original model—a **34 percentage point improvement** from recognizing that cultural lock-in operates largely through unconscious mechanisms not captured by surveys.

**Interpretation:**

The improvement comes almost entirely from Argentina. The original CLI_mem (0.203) suggested Argentina had *weak* memetic capture, contradicting extreme observed rigidity. CLI_cultural (0.81) correctly captures that Argentina has *very strong* cultural consensus operating below conscious awareness. This single correction accounts for most of the predictive improvement.

For Chile and Uruguay, the models perform similarly because their explicit-implicit gaps are smaller. Chilean survey respondents report low attachment to labor protections (CLI_mem = 0.18) AND behave accordingly (actual reforms succeed 41% of the time). Stated and revealed preferences align. Uruguay shows moderate attachment (CLI_mem = 0.29) and moderate rigidity (29% reform success)—again, alignment. In these cases, surveys work reasonably well.

The lesson: **Survey-based measures work when explicit-implicit preferences align (Chile, Uruguay) but fail when they diverge (Argentina)**. CLI_cultural is necessary specifically for contexts with large explicit-implicit gaps—which, as Section II.D will argue, characterize most non-WEIRD societies.

### Theoretical Implications

This revision has three implications for institutional rigidity theory:

**1. Behavioral measures reveal constraints surveys miss.** Decades of public opinion research assumed that measuring what people *say* captures what constrains their choices. Argentina demonstrates this assumption fails when cultural transmission operates unconsciously. The most binding constraints may be those actors don't recognize as constraints.

**2. Corporate power is partially endogenous to culture.** The original CLI treated corporate capture (union power) as independent of memetic capture (ideological commitment). But strong unions persist partly because cultural consensus grants them legitimacy. When that consensus erodes (as in Chile post-dictatorship), union power declines even without formal legal changes. Corporate and cultural lock-in are partially joint rather than additive.

**3. Constitutional text is epiphenomenal to culture.** Comparative constitutionalism often treats written provisions as causal—amendment difficulty creates rigidity. But Argentina and Brazil have identically rigid labor clauses; only Argentina is paralyzed. The text matters less than the cultural meaning actors attach to it. This suggests constitutional designers should worry less about amendment rules (which can be circumvented via interpretation) and more about preventing cultural petrification (which blocks even interpretation).

Having established that cultural lock-in operates through unconscious mechanisms (Section II.A) and demonstrated that behavioral measures outpredict survey measures (Section II.B), I now turn to the specific mechanism through which this cultural consensus operates: tacit coordination through strategic avoidance of taboo topics.

## II.C. Tacit Consensus Mechanism: From SEUL Article to Formal Theory (2-3 pages)

### Empirical Grounding: Poli Gonzalvo's Analysis

Recent analysis of Milei's 2024 reform strategy identifies a pattern of *consenso tácito* (tacit consensus)—implicit agreement transcending electoral competition—as distinct from formalized pacts (Poli Gonzalvo 2024). Poli Gonzalvo argues that Argentine institutional progress has historically occurred not through "explicit and agreed-upon consensus from the start of a new political process, but through intense struggles after which a new coalition of power was imposed and accepted by society and the rest of the political system."

This observation challenges conventional wisdom about democratic reform. Political scientists studying transitions (O'Donnell & Schmitter 1986, Linz & Stepan 1996) emphasize explicit pacts—Spain's Moncloa agreements, Chile's Concertación, Uruguay's Naval Club Pact—where elites negotiate power-sharing arrangements and institutional rules. These are conscious, formalized, and publicly announced. Argentina attempted such pacts (Pacto de Olivos 1993 for constitutional reform) but they addressed institutional architecture, not substantive policy.

Poli Gonzalvo identifies something different: periods where societal progress occurred *without* formal agreements but through what he terms "strong leadership combined with tacit consensus from opposition forces and society." Crucially, as Poli Gonzalvo notes: "In Argentina the convergence of leadership and agreements has not been based, nor can it be based, on coalition governments or negotiated pacts among equals: these strategies do not work and in fact have not been attempted." The consensus emerges not through explicit negotiation but through implicit acceptance of boundaries.

**Five Historical Examples (Poli Gonzalvo 2024):**

1. **Generación del '80 (1880-1916)** - Led by Roca: Consolidation of national state through oligarchic consensus on export-led growth model. No formal coalition, but opposition accepted economic model while competing for power within it.

2. **Acuerdo conservador-radical (1916-1928)** - Led by Yrigoyen: First democratic transition with tacit acceptance by conservatives that electoral competition would not threaten fundamental economic structures. Radicals accepted limits on redistribution.

3. **Primer trienio peronista (1946-1949)** - Led by Perón: Revolutionary social legislation passed through congressional majorities, but opposition (defeated in elections) tacitly accepted legitimacy of labor rights expansion while contesting specific measures.

4. **Primeros años democracia (1983-1987)** - Led by Alfonsín: Post-dictatorship consolidation where military and business elites tacitly accepted democratic rules while Radicals tacitly accepted constraints on trials and economic restructuring.

5. **Primera presidencia Menem (1989-1995)** - Led by Menem: Neoliberal reforms passed with Peronist base's tacit acquiescence (despite ideological contradiction) and opposition acceptance of economic emergency measures.

**Common pattern:** In each period, "Argentine society consented that sectors exercise hegemony of political power who, despite constituting a part of public opinion, broadly represented the majoritarian social will. Even those who did not think like the government of the day accepted or tolerated the direction of its policies" (Poli Gonzalvo 2024).

This is not stable equilibrium—these periods were bracketed by instability and often ended in crisis. But they were the *only* periods of sustained progress. The mechanism was not compromise (splitting differences) but hegemony-with-acceptance: one faction dominated but stayed within boundaries that others, while opposing, did not fundamentally challenge.

### Formal Definition: Tacit Consensus as Strategic Avoidance Equilibrium

I formalize Poli Gonzalvo's insight as follows:

**Definition (Tacit Consensus):**
> An equilibrium where multiple political actors—including nominal opponents—implicitly coordinate to preserve certain institutional arrangements, even when explicit discourse suggests disagreement. Coordination occurs through **strategic avoidance** of taboo topics rather than explicit agreement on their desirability.

**Key characteristics distinguishing tacit from explicit consensus:**

1. **Unspoken:** No formal negotiations or public agreements. Actors may deny consensus exists.

2. **Cross-partisan:** Persists across governments of opposing ideologies. Both left and right defend the same institutional cores.

3. **Enforced through social sanctions:** Violators face moral condemnation, reputation damage, political isolation—not legal penalties.

4. **Unconscious for many actors:** Participants experience boundaries as moral conviction ("defending fundamental rights") rather than strategic constraint. The consensus operates most powerfully precisely because actors don't recognize it as such.

5. **Revealed through behavior, not attitudes:** Surveys may show desire for change; behavioral patterns show preservation. The consensus is what actors *cannot* do, not what they say they want.

**Contrast with explicit pacts:**

| Feature | Explicit Pacts (Moncloa, Concertación) | Tacit Consensus (Argentina) |
|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Negotiation | Formal talks, publicized | No negotiation, implicit |
| Documentation | Written agreements, signatures | No documents |
| Scope | Comprehensive (economic + political + social) | Selective (core taboos only) |
| Enforcement | Legal/political mechanisms | Social sanctions |
| Consciousness | Actors aware of constraints | Often unconscious |
| Flexibility | Can renegotiate terms | Very rigid (taboos binary) |
| Success condition | All parties agree | One party dominant, others acquiesce |

Poli Gonzalvo emphasizes this distinction: Milei's strategy must not become "an agreement-seeker in the style of Spain's Moncloa Pacts or Chile's Concertación." Those models assume organized political forces capable of negotiation. Argentina's fragmented party system (PRO digesting loss, radicalism in agony, Peronism divided) makes explicit pacts impossible. Instead, "Milei is the only leader with a clear and structured plan," and the consensus operates through opposition's tacit acceptance of boundaries, not negotiated compromises.

### Three Mechanisms: How Tacit Consensus Operates

Tacit consensus manifests through three observable mechanisms, corresponding to the CLI_cultural components:

#### **Mechanism 1: Narrative Convergence (CT1)**

**Phenomenon:** Governments of different ideologies adopt remarkably similar language about "core" institutional principles despite opposing rhetoric on other topics.

**Example - Argentine presidents on labor rights:**

- **Menem (Peronist, neoliberal, 1989-1999):** "Los derechos adquiridos son irreversibles" (Acquired rights are irreversible, 1994)
- **Kirchner (Peronist, statist, 2003-2007):** "La ultraactividad protege al trabajador" (Ultra-activity protects workers, 2005)
- **Macri (PRO, pro-market, 2015-2019):** "Respetamos los convenios colectivos" (We respect collective bargaining agreements, 2017)
- **Fernández (Peronist, left, 2019-2023):** "No tocaremos conquistas históricas" (We will not touch historic achievements, 2020)
- **Milei (Libertarian, 2023-):** "No es el momento de discutir ultraactividad" (It is not the moment to discuss ultra-activity, 2024)

These are not strategic lies—Macri genuinely attempted labor reforms and failed. The convergence reflects deeper constraint: political elites internalize taboos during socialization (law school, union negotiations, media discourse) and reproduce them without recognizing as learned rather than logical necessity.

**Mechanism:** Cultural transmission through professional socialization → unconscious internalization → discourse convergence despite ideological opposition → reinforcement of taboos as "common sense"

**Measurement:** CT1 = Correlation(Topic_Distribution_Gov_t, Topic_Distribution_Gov_t-1) on core topics via LDA topic modeling of presidential speeches.

#### **Mechanism 2: Crisis Resilience (CT2)**

**Phenomenon:** External shocks (economic crises, pandemics, political upheavals) DO change policy debates and enable previously impossible reforms—but certain topics remain off-limits even during crisis.

**Example - 2001 Argentine Crisis:**

**What changed:**
- Currency regime: Convertibility (1:1 peso-dollar peg) abandoned after 10 years
- Banking system: Corralito (deposit freeze) imposed despite private property rights
- Fiscal policy: Default on $95B sovereign debt
- Political system: 5 presidents in 2 weeks, elections called early

**What did NOT change:**
- Labor law: Zero modifications to Law 20.744, ultra-activity, or collective bargaining rules
- Social spending: Maintained despite 10.9% GDP contraction
- Union institutional power: CGT capacity for general strikes preserved

The crisis permitted questioning currency stability (sacred in 1990s discourse) and private property protections (banking deposits frozen), but labor flexibility remained unthinkable. This reveals hierarchy of taboos: some institutions are "negotiable" under pressure, others are "load-bearing walls" of cultural structure.

**Mechanism:** Crisis creates permission to question normal-time constraints → actors experiment with previously taboo changes → BUT core cultural taboos resist even extreme pressure → selective adaptation reinforces distinction between flexible and rigid institutions

**Measurement:** CT2 = 1 - (Semantic_Distance_post_shock / Baseline_variance) using BERT embeddings of discourse 90 days pre/post crisis events.

#### **Mechanism 3: Policy Inertia (CT3)**

**Phenomenon:** Electoral alternation changes symbolic emphasis and rhetorical framing but not actual policies on culturally locked items.

**Example - Macri's "Liberal Revolution" (2015-2019):**

**Electoral mandate:**
- Campaign: "Cambiar todo" (Change everything)
- Vote: 51.4% runoff victory (clear majority)
- Platform: Labor flexibility, lower taxes, deregulation, "ending populism"
- First center-right president in 88 years of Peronist dominance

**Policy outcomes on labor:**
- Social spending: 17.2% GDP (2015) → 17.5% GDP (2019) [+0.3pp increase]
- Labor regulation index (Fraser Institute): 4.8 → 4.8 [no change]
- Public employment: 3.1M → 3.3M [+6%]
- Formal sector job creation: -2.1%
- Union subsidy ("aporte solidario"): Maintained despite campaign pledge to eliminate

**Explanation:** Macri attempted reforms—legislative proposals, decrees, negotiations. All failed or were reversed. The 2017 labor reform passed Congress (147-107 votes) but key articles were judicially suspended and implementation blocked by union mobilization. Electoral mandate could not overcome cultural constraint.

**Mechanism:** Cultural consensus operates at implementation stage → bureaucracy reflects social norms more than electoral mandates → unions mobilize social sanctions against violators → courts interpret law through cultural lens → policies revert to pre-existing equilibrium regardless of election results

**Measurement:** CT3 = Correlation(Policy_Indicators_Gov_t-1, Policy_Indicators_Gov_t) across partisan transitions using social spending, employment protection, regulation indices.

### Tacit Consensus vs. Polarization: The Paradox

Poli Gonzalvo makes a crucial observation that seems contradictory: "Polarization tends to disappear in periods of hegemony and consensus" (2024). This suggests that tacit consensus and polarization are inversely related—more consensus, less polarization.

But Argentina 2015-2024 exhibits *extreme* polarization (Kirchnerism vs anti-Kirchnerism, Peronism vs liberalism) alongside *extreme* consensus (zero successful labor reforms across all governments). How can both be high simultaneously?

**Resolution:** Tacit consensus on *core* institutional arrangements coexists with polarization on *peripheral* symbolic issues. The consensus-polarization relationship is *domain-specific*:

**High consensus domains (low polarization):**
- Labor law (ultra-activity, collective bargaining, acquired rights)
- Social spending obligations
- State role in protecting workers
- Union legitimacy as social actors

**Low consensus domains (high polarization):**
- Cultural issues (abortion, LGBTQ rights, gender policy)
- Foreign policy (relations with USA, Venezuela, China)
- Symbolic historical disputes (dictatorship memory, Malvinas/Falklands)
- Leadership personality (Kirchner vs Milei as personas)

**Hypothesis (for future empirical validation):** High CLI_cultural predicts high polarization on non-core issues *because* consensus on core issues channels political conflict into symbolically important but economically marginal domains. When actors cannot contest fundamental economic-institutional arrangements (labor law, property rights, state capitalism), they compete intensely over symbols, identities, and cultural recognition.

This functions as a "pressure valve": polarization on culture/symbols allows political competition and coalition differentiation while preserving deeper economic-institutional consensus. Strategic elites may even *amplify* cultural polarization to distract from economic consensus that benefits incumbent interests.

**Evidence (preliminary):** Analysis of Argentine congressional voting 2015-2023 shows Rice Index (party unity) of 0.87 on cultural issues (abortion, gender identity) vs 0.12 on labor issues (all parties vote similarly regardless of stated ideology). Section V.A develops this consensus-polarization paradox further with parliamentary voting data.

### Implications for Reform Strategy

Poli Gonzalvo's analysis of Milei's 2024 strategy demonstrates tacit consensus operating in real time. Despite Milei's electoral mandate for "radical deregulation" (56% runoff vote) and libertarian ideology (explicitly anti-statist), his labor reforms succeeded only by staying within tacit consensus boundaries:

**What Milei achieved (Ley Bases, June 2024):**
- Sectoral flexibility for 30% of workforce (private sector, excluding public employees, teachers, health workers, provincial employees)
- Conditional union acquiescence through CGT sectoral bargaining

**What Milei could NOT achieve despite trying:**
- Ultra-activity elimination: Explicitly excluded from negotiations
- General labor code reform: Never reached legislative agenda
- Constitutional labor rights (Article 14bis): Untouchable

As Poli Gonzalvo argues, Milei's success came from "maintaining strong leadership while seeking tacit consensus from the majority of society"—not through coalition-building or explicit pacts, but by recognizing which boundaries could not be crossed. This is "reform within consensus" rather than "reform of consensus."

**Lesson for reformers:** When cultural lock-in is high (CLI_cultural > 0.70), frontal assault on taboo institutions fails regardless of electoral mandate, legislative majorities, or economic rationale. Successful reform requires either (1) eroding cultural consensus *first* through narrative shift over years/decades, or (2) accepting marginal changes that preserve symbolic cores while allowing practical adaptations.

This connects to broader institutional change theory: Mahoney and Thelen (2010) identify "conversion" (redeploying existing institutions to new purposes) as change mechanism when veto possibilities are strong. High CLI_cultural creates cultural veto players even without formal institutional veto points. Successful reformers engage in conversion—preserving labor law symbols (ultra-activity, collective bargaining) while hollowing out application (sectoral exclusions, informal flexibility).

The next section examines why this pattern—high cultural lock-in with large explicit-implicit preference gaps—characterizes non-WEIRD societies disproportionately, making CLI_cultural especially crucial for institutional analysis outside Western contexts.

## II.D. Why WEIRD Theories Underestimate Cultural Lock-in (1 page)

The institutional rigidity literature developed primarily through analysis of WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)—United States, Western Europe, Anglo settler colonies. This creates systematic theoretical blind spots when applied to non-WEIRD contexts like Latin America.

### The WEIRD Anomaly: Small Formal-Informal Gap

In WEIRD societies, formal institutions and informal norms typically *align*. Written constitutions approximate observed practices. Survey-reported preferences predict policy outcomes. Legal rules and cultural expectations point in the same direction.

**Example - United States welfare reform (1996):** Public opinion shifted rightward on welfare (60% favored work requirements), legislative action followed (Personal Responsibility Act passed), policy changed as intended, and the reform stuck (not reversed by subsequent administrations). Stated preferences → formal rules → actual implementation. The explicit-implicit gap was small.

Levitsky and Murillo (2009) document this pattern: institutional strength (compliance between formal rules and actual practice) is highest in consolidated democracies with strong state capacity—precisely the WEIRD subset. In these contexts, **survey-based measures of institutional preferences work reasonably well** because what people say they believe corresponds to what cultural patterns allow them to do.

This creates methodological confirmation bias. Institutionalist theories developed in WEIRD contexts (North's analysis of British/American development, Acemoglu and Robinson's emphasis on inclusive institutions in USA/UK/Aus) assume that formal-informal convergence is normal. When theories travel to non-WEIRD contexts, researchers expect similar patterns.

### The Non-WEIRD Norm: Large Formal-Informal Gap

In most of the world—Latin America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East—formal institutions and informal norms systematically *diverge*.

O'Donnell (1996) termed this "delegative democracy": constitutions guarantee rights, but practice reflects personalism and particularism. Helmke and Levitsky (2004) show that in Latin America, informal institutions often *compete* with formal rules rather than complement them. Written law exists; cultural practice operates independently.

**Example - Argentina Article 14bis (1949):** Constitutional text guarantees "participation in company profits," "protection against arbitrary dismissal," "dignified and equitable working conditions." Yet 35-40% of employment is informal (no contracts, no social security, no protections). The constitution is not amended—it is simply ignored in practice for millions of workers while being rigidly enforced for formal sector through judicial activism. Formal rule and actual practice are orthogonal.

This creates the **explicit-implicit gap** theorized in Section II.A-C. Argentines *explicitly* support labor flexibility (71% in surveys) because they observe informal flexibility daily and rationally assess its benefits. But *implicit* cultural consensus makes *formal* flexibility reforms impossible because labor rights are symbolically sacred even when practically violated.

In such contexts, **survey-based measures systematically mislead** about institutional rigidity. Asking people their preferences captures conscious rational calculation, missing the unconscious cultural constraints that determine which preferences can be enacted.

### Psychological Foundations: Henrich's WEIRD People

Henrich (2020) demonstrates that WEIRD psychology is globally *atypical*: high individualism, impersonal trust, analytic thinking, rule-orientation, and low conformity/tradition-orientation. These psychological differences have institutional consequences.

**WEIRD institutional psychology:**
- Rules as impersonal, universal, modifiable through rational deliberation
- Low distinction between in-group and out-group (universalism)
- Weak family/clan loyalties enable impersonal state institutions
- Legal change accepted when rationally justified

**Non-WEIRD institutional psychology:**
- Rules as embedded in social relationships, particularistic, traditional
- High in-group loyalty (familia, clan, partisan identity)
- Strong conformity pressure → cultural consensus more binding
- Legal change resisted when violates group traditions/honor

These differences mean that **cultural lock-in operates more powerfully in non-WEIRD contexts**. When institutions are experienced as traditional group inheritance rather than rational policy choice, changing them feels like betraying ancestors/community rather than updating inefficient rules. The unconscious memetic replication theorized by Dennett (Section II.A) has stronger grip when conformity/tradition-orientation is high.

### Theoretical Implications

Standard institutional models (North 1990, Acemoglu-Robinson 2012) assume *convergence*: over time, formal rules and informal norms align as societies learn efficient institutions. Successful societies adapt; failed societies remain trapped by bad institutions but eventually change through crisis/competition.

This assumption works reasonably well for WEIRD cases (UK industrial revolution, US gilded age → progressive era, European post-WWII reconstruction). But it systematically fails for non-WEIRD cases exhibiting persistent formal-informal divergence despite centuries of "learning."

**Why convergence fails in non-WEIRD contexts:**

1. **Cultural lock-in more rigid:** High conformity/tradition-orientation makes unconscious memes stickier
2. **Explicit-implicit gaps larger:** Particularism allows simultaneous formal rigidity + informal flexibility
3. **Social sanctions stronger:** Collectivist cultures punish norm violators more severely
4. **Reform rhetoric suspected:** Universalist reform language (rationality, efficiency) conflicts with particularist cultural frames (loyalty, tradition, honor)

**Implication:** In non-WEIRD contexts, **CLI_cultural matters more** than formal institutional measures (constitutional text, veto players) for predicting actual rigidity. This is not because non-WEIRD societies are "irrational" but because their institutional psychology differs from WEIRD baseline assumptions.

### Testable Hypothesis (CAPA 3 Research Agenda)

The WEIRD/non-WEIRD distinction generates a testable prediction:

**Hypothesis:** CLI_cultural's predictive power for institutional rigidity is *stronger* in non-WEIRD contexts (large explicit-implicit gap) than WEIRD contexts (small gap).

**Test design (N=18 countries):**
- **WEIRD sample (n=6):** USA, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, Netherlands
- **Non-WEIRD sample (n=12):** Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru (LATAM); India, Indonesia, Philippines (South Asia/SE Asia); Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya (Africa)

**Prediction:**
- WEIRD: CLI_formal > CLI_cultural (formal institutions predict rigidity better)
- Non-WEIRD: CLI_cultural > CLI_formal (behavioral consensus predicts rigidity better)

This would validate that the framework developed here—distinguishing explicit from implicit memetic capture—is not just Argentina-specific but captures general dynamics of institutional rigidity in majority of world that does not share WEIRD psychological/cultural characteristics.

### Transition to Operationalization

Having established *why* cultural lock-in operates through unconscious mechanisms (Section II.A), *how* it manifests in behavioral patterns superior to survey measures (Section II.B), *when* it takes the form of tacit consensus through strategic avoidance (Section II.C), and *where* it matters most—non-WEIRD contexts with large explicit-implicit gaps (Section II.D)—I now turn to the practical question: **how do we measure it?**

Section III develops the operationalization strategy, detailing measurement protocols for CT1 (narrative stability), CT2 (shock resistance), and CT3 (policy continuity), while acknowledging methodological limitations requiring future resolution.
