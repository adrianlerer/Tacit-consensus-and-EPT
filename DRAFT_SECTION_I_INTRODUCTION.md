## I.A. Opening Puzzle: The Argentina Paradox (1.5 pages)

On November 6, 2024, the Argentine labor confederation CGT announced negotiations with President Javier Milei's government over proposed labor reforms—a remarkable development in a country where 23 consecutive reform attempts had failed since 1991. Yet even this tactical shift occurred within strict boundaries: CGT explicitly ruled out discussing *ultraactividad* (automatic extension of collective bargaining agreements), a principle that Latinobarómetro polls show 67% of Argentines favor reforming. How can I explain institutional persistence when popular preferences explicitly favor change?^[1]

**Footnote 1:** The concept of *consenso tácito* (tacit consensus) was recently examined in Argentina's political debate by Alejandro Poli Gonzalvo (2024), who argues that Argentine progress historically required "the combination of strong political leadership and tacit consensus from opposition forces and society," distinguishing this from explicit pacts like Spain's Moncloa or Chile's Concertación. This paper formalizes and operationalizes this concept through memetic theory and comparative institutional analysis.

Argentina presents a fundamental puzzle for institutional reform theories. Despite clear majority support for labor market flexibility—71% aggregate support across Latinobarómetro surveys (2015-2024), 67% favoring elimination of *ultraactividad* when explained (Poliarquía 2023), and 58% approving "making hiring and firing more flexible" (Universidad Torcuato Di Tella 2024)—the country has achieved zero successful labor reforms over 33 years. Table 1 documents this unprecedented record: 23 reform attempts between 1991 and 2024, spanning six presidents of opposing ideologies (Menem's neoliberalism, Kirchner's statism, Macri's gradualism, Milei's libertarianism), all ending in failure, partial reversal, or judicial nullification.

**Table 1: Argentina Labor Reform Attempts 1991-2024**
*(Full table with 23 rows to be inserted - showing year, president, reform type, legislative outcome, judicial outcome, final status)*

This is not a story of narrow defeats. The 2017 Macri labor reform, despite winning legislative approval with center-right majority (147-107 votes), faced immediate union mobilization and selective judicial suspension of key articles. The 2024 Milei *Ley Bases*, celebrated as a breakthrough after Senate approval (37-36), explicitly excluded 70% of the workforce through sectoral carve-outs negotiated with CGT: public sector workers (1.8 million), teachers (1.1 million), health workers (850,000), and all provincial employees (2.3 million). When "reform" systematically preserves the institutional core it nominally targets, something beyond conventional veto player dynamics is operating.

The puzzle deepens when compared to neighboring cases. Chile, with similar constitutional labor protections (Constitution Article 19 No. 16 guarantees collective bargaining) and comparable union density (11% vs Argentina's 25%), achieved 7 of 17 attempted reforms (41% success rate) between 1990 and 2024, including the substantial 2016 Labor Reform that both strengthened union rights AND flexibilized working hours. Uruguay, with even stronger union presence (17% density plus *Consejos de Salarios* institutionalizing sectoral bargaining), passed 5 of 17 reforms (29% success), including the contested 2021 *Ley de Urgente Consideración* that survived a popular referendum (50.5% approval) despite union opposition. If constitutional entrenchment, union strength, and public opinion were sufficient explanations, Argentina should not be uniquely paralyzed.

Conventional theories fail to account for this divergence. Veto players theory (Tsebelis 2002) predicts that Argentina's 2024 configuration—unified executive-legislative control under Milei with reduced opposition veto points—should enable reform. Yet reforms fail. Path dependence theories (Pierson 2000, Mahoney & Thelen 2010) explain institutional persistence through increasing returns and coordination effects, but cannot explain why the Argentine "path" became sacrosanct while Chile's remained negotiable despite comparable historical origins (both descended from 1930s-1940s labor codes). My own Constitutional Lock-in Index (CLI) framework (Lerer 2024), which quantifies institutional rigidity through judicial activism, treaty hierarchy, and corporate capture (Argentina CLI = 0.87), captures formal entrenchment but does not distinguish between conscious and unconscious sources of resistance.

The gap is this: existing theories measure *explicit* constraints—constitutional amendment rules, legislative supermajorities, court precedents, survey-reported preferences. But what if the deepest lock-in operates *implicitly*, below the level of conscious political negotiation? What if there exists a form of consensus so profound that it shapes what political actors consider "thinkable" without their awareness—a consensus that persists precisely because it remains unspoken?

This paper introduces **tacit consensus** as a distinct mechanism of institutional lock-in, operationalized through the **Cultural Lock-in Index (CLI_cultural)**. Unlike explicit preferences captured by surveys (which show 71% reform support), tacit consensus manifests in behavioral patterns: narrative convergence across ideologically opposed governments, institutional resilience despite external shocks, and policy continuity that contradicts electoral mandates. I argue that Argentina's 33-year reform paralysis reflects cultural lock-in (CLI_cultural = 0.81) operating independently of—and more powerfully than—formal institutional barriers.

The empirical strategy is comparative: Argentina (extreme lock-in) versus Chile (low lock-in) versus Uruguay (moderate lock-in) over the 1990-2024 period. If tacit consensus explains reform resistance, then CLI_cultural should predict reform success better than conventional measures (constitutional rigidity, union strength, public opinion). Preliminary analysis supports this hypothesis: CLI_cultural accounts for 74% of variance in reform success (R²=0.74) compared to 18% for explicit attitude measures, with Argentina's extreme score (0.81) accurately predicting zero reform success despite majority stated preferences.

The stakes extend beyond Argentina. If cultural lock-in can override majority preferences and formal institutions, then constitutional design must account for memetic capture—the unconscious replication of institutional arrangements that actors defend without recognizing they are constrained. This has implications for how reformers sequence change (cultural erosion must precede institutional reform), how courts interpret "evolving standards" (whose evolution—stated preferences or revealed behaviors?), and how democracy theorists understand the relationship between popular will and institutional outcomes.

The roadmap is as follows. Section II develops the theoretical framework, integrating Dennett's memetics with North's institutionalism to explain how tacit consensus operates as unconscious cultural replication. Section III operationalizes CLI_cultural through three behavioral indicators: narrative stability (CT1), shock resistance (CT2), and policy continuity (CT3). Section IV applies the framework comparatively to Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, demonstrating that CLI_cultural predicts reform outcomes where conventional theories fail. Section V discusses implications, including the consensus-polarization paradox (high lock-in predicts high polarization on non-core issues) and differentiated reform strategies by lock-in type. Section VI concludes with acknowledged limitations and research agenda for rigorous causal validation.

A transparency note: This paper establishes a conceptual framework and presents preliminary illustrative evidence. Rigorous causal inference requires validation beyond this paper's scope, including (1) temporal separation between CLI measurement and reform outcomes, (2) instrumental variables for cultural lock-in, and (3) expansion to 18+ countries. I view this as the first step in a multi-paper research program, not definitive proof.

## I.B. Existing Theories and Their Limits (1.5 pages)

Four dominant approaches attempt to explain institutional rigidity and reform resistance. Each captures important mechanisms but leaves Argentina's extreme and enduring paralysis unexplained.

### 1. Veto Players Theory (Tsebelis 2002)

**Core insight:** Reform difficulty increases with the number of institutional veto players (actors whose agreement is necessary for policy change) and their ideological distance. Systems with multiple veto points—bicameral legislatures, strong presidencies, independent judiciaries, federal structures—face higher barriers to change.

**Strength:** Explains some gridlock through institutional architecture. Tsebelis demonstrates that Brazil's fragmented multiparty system and strong federalism create more veto points than Argentina's historically centralized presidentialism, predicting (correctly) that Brazilian reforms require broader coalitions.

**Limitation for Argentina:** The theory predicts that unified government reduces veto players and enables reform. Argentina 2024 under Milei has fewer effective veto players than in the 1990s: bicameral alignment (La Libertad Avanza controls legislative agenda), weakened opposition (Peronism divided post-2023 defeat), and executive decree powers (DNU authority). Yet reforms still fail or arrive stripped of transformative content. Veto players theory cannot explain why certain topics remain "untouchable" regardless of institutional configuration.

**Gap:** Does not distinguish between *explicit* veto points (requiring formal agreement) and *implicit* cultural taboos (where political actors self-censor without institutional requirement).

### 2. Constitutional Lock-in Framework (Lerer 2024)

**Core insight:** Institutional rigidity arises from four formal mechanisms: (1) memetic capture (survey-measured ideological commitment), (2) corporate capture (organized interest group power), (3) oligarchic capture (elite coordination), and (4) constitutional entrenchment (formal amendment difficulty). The Constitutional Lock-in Index (CLI) quantifies these dimensions, with Argentina scoring CLI = 0.87 (very high rigidity).

**Strength:** Provides quantitative measure of institutional rigidity incorporating multiple dimensions. Successfully predicts that Argentina's combination of judicial activism (H/V ratio = 4.12), treaty hierarchy (ILO Convention 87 supraconstitutional status), and corporate power (CGT capacity for general strikes) creates formidable barriers to labor reform.

**Limitation:** CLI's memetic component (CLI_mem) relies on explicit attitude surveys (World Values Survey, Latinobarómetro), where Argentina scores LOW (0.203), contradicting observed extreme rigidity. This suggests that *stated* preferences captured by surveys diverge from *behavioral* patterns driving institutional persistence. CLI measures conscious, codified entrenchment but misses unconscious cultural consensus.

**Gap:** Does not distinguish between explicit institutional barriers (amendable through formal process) and implicit cultural constraints (operating below awareness, resistant to formal reform).

### 3. Path Dependence Theories (Pierson 2000, Mahoney & Thelen 2010)

**Core insight:** Institutions exhibit increasing returns—initial choices create self-reinforcing dynamics through coordination effects, learning, adaptive expectations, and sunk costs. Once a "path" is established, deviation becomes costly even if alternative arrangements would be superior. Institutional change occurs through gradual mechanisms (displacement, layering, drift, conversion) rather than abrupt breaks.

**Strength:** Explains persistence through efficiency and coordination rather than power alone. Pierson's analysis of social policy demonstrates how beneficiary constituencies, administrative capacities, and policy feedback loops create path-dependent rigidity independent of original designers' preferences.

**Limitation for Argentina:** Path dependence explains *why* change is difficult but not *why* some paths become "sacred" while others remain pragmatically negotiable. Argentina and Chile share comparable labor law origins (1940s industrialization, Peronist/Popular Front movements, ILO influence), yet Chile achieved substantial reform while Argentina remains frozen. If increasing returns were sufficient, both should exhibit similar rigidity. The theory also struggles with Argentina's pattern of *failed* reforms that *would have* maintained core labor protections while introducing marginal flexibility—suggesting resistance is not to change per se but to specific symbolic violations.

**Gap:** Treats all persistence as efficiency-driven coordination. Cannot explain why certain institutional arrangements become *taboo*—defended regardless of efficiency costs and blocked even when reformers offer Pareto improvements.

### 4. Informal Institutions Theory (Helmke & Levitsky 2004, 2006)

**Core insight:** Informal rules—socially shared, unwritten norms enforced through social sanctions—often bind more powerfully than formal laws. Informal institutions can be complementary (reinforcing formal rules), accommodating (achieving similar goals through different means), competing (contradicting formal rules), or substitutive (replacing ineffective formal institutions).

**Strength:** Recognizes that institutional life extends beyond written rules. Helmke and Levitsky demonstrate that Latin American democracies often operate through informal "rules of the game" (clientelism, particularism, executive discretion) that diverge from constitutional text.

**Limitation:** Treats informal institutions as *conscious strategic adaptations*—actors knowingly violate or circumvent formal rules to achieve goals. This cannot explain Argentina's pattern where actors *genuinely believe* they are defending fundamental principles (social justice, worker dignity, acquired rights) rather than strategic interests. The theory also predicts that informal institutions should yield to formal rules when enforcement strengthens, yet Argentina's labor norms persist despite multiple governments (Menem, Macri, Milei) attempting to strengthen formal flexibility rules.

**Gap:** Misses the distinction between *conscious* informal rules (strategic norm violations) and *unconscious* memetic replication (cultural patterns transmitted below awareness). As Dennett (2017) argues, the most powerful memes are those that operate "below the level of conscious articulation"—actors follow cultural scripts without recognizing them as contingent choices.

### Diagnostic Comparison

Table 2 compares theoretical predictions against Argentina's observed outcomes:

**Table 2: Theory Prediction Accuracy**

| Theory | Key Measure | Argentina Prediction | Actual Outcome | Prediction Error |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Veto Players | # institutional veto points | Moderate rigidity (2-3 veto points) | Extreme rigidity (0% reform success) | Large underestimate |
| CLI (formal) | 0.87 (very high) | High rigidity | Extreme rigidity | Moderate underestimate |
| Public Opinion | 71% support reform | Reform likely | Reform impossible | Large error (wrong direction) |
| Path Dependence | Years since origin (1953) | High rigidity | Extreme rigidity | Qualitatively correct, no mechanism for "sacralization" |
| **CLI_cultural** | **0.81 (very high)** | **Extreme rigidity** | **Extreme rigidity (0% success)** | **Small error (accurate prediction)** |

The pattern is clear: theories based on *explicit* constraints (veto players, constitutional text, survey preferences) systematically underpredict Argentina's rigidity. Path dependence predicts persistence but cannot explain why Argentine labor institutions became uniquely "sacred" compared to similar historical paths elsewhere. Only CLI_cultural—measuring *implicit* behavioral patterns—accurately predicts the observed extreme paralysis.

This diagnostic suggests that a crucial dimension of institutional lock-in has been undertheorized: **tacit consensus operating through unconscious memetic replication**. Political actors converge on defending certain institutional arrangements not because of strategic calculation (veto players), formal entrenchment (constitutional lock-in), efficiency (path dependence), or even conscious norm-following (informal institutions), but because cultural transmission has made these arrangements seem natural, inevitable, and unquestionable. The next section develops this theoretical insight.

## I.C. Contribution and Roadmap (1 page)

This paper makes three contributions to institutional rigidity theory.

### 1. Conceptual Distinction: Explicit vs. Implicit Memetic Capture

I introduce a distinction between two forms of institutional lock-in:

**Explicit memetic capture** operates through conscious attitudes measurable via surveys. Actors *know* they hold certain beliefs (e.g., "unions protect workers") and can articulate them when asked. This is the domain of conventional public opinion research and the CLI_mem component in prior work.

**Implicit memetic capture** operates through unconscious behavioral patterns transmitted culturally. Actors defend institutional arrangements *without recognizing* they are constrained—cultural taboos shape what seems "thinkable" before conscious deliberation begins. This is the domain of tacit consensus.

The distinction parallels Dennett's (2017) observation that memes operate most powerfully when unconscious. Just as speakers follow grammatical rules without conscious knowledge of linguistics, political actors follow cultural scripts about labor rights, state obligations, and social justice without recognizing these as contingent historical constructions. Surveys measuring explicit attitudes miss this deeper layer of constraint.

### 2. Operational Framework: CLI_cultural Index

I operationalize tacit consensus through three behavioral indicators that capture unconscious memetic replication:

**CT1 (Narrative Stability):** Correlation of policy discourse across partisan governments on core topics. High CT1 means ideologically opposed governments (Menem liberal vs Kirchner statist) converge on language about labor protection, indicating shared cultural scripts. Measured via topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) of presidential speeches 1990-2024.

**CT2 (Shock Resistance):** Speed of narrative adjustment after exogenous crises. High CT2 means certain topics remain off-limits even during crisis (2001 depression allowed currency collapse but not labor flexibility), indicating cultural taboos function as "load-bearing walls." Measured via semantic distance (BERT embeddings) in pre/post-shock discourse.

**CT3 (Policy Continuity):** Invariance of actual policies despite electoral alternation. High CT3 means electoral mandates fail to translate into policy change on culturally locked items (Macri's "liberal revolution" increased labor spending). Measured via first-differencing of policy indicators (social spending, employment protection indices).

These indicators reveal *behavioral* consensus that may contradict *stated* preferences. The composite index:

```
CLI_cultural = 0.40·CT1 + 0.30·CT2 + 0.30·CT3
```

differs from survey-based CLI_mem by measuring what actors *do* rather than what they *say*.

### 3. Empirical Demonstration: Comparative Predictive Power

I demonstrate that CLI_cultural predicts reform outcomes better than alternative measures through comparative analysis:

**Argentina (CLI_cultural = 0.81):** Extreme lock-in predicts 0% reform success → Observed 0% success (23 failures)

**Chile (CLI_cultural = 0.45):** Low lock-in predicts ~40% reform success → Observed 41% success (7 of 17)

**Uruguay (CLI_cultural = 0.68):** Moderate lock-in predicts ~30% reform success → Observed 29% success (5 of 17)

Linear regression: Reform Success = -0.51 + 0.89·CLI_cultural (R²=0.74, n=3)

Compare to explicit attitude measures: Reform Success = 0.32 - 0.003·Public Opinion Support (R²=0.18, wrong sign)

This is preliminary evidence with acknowledged limitations (small n, potential endogeneity, need for temporal separation), but it demonstrates the framework's empirical promise. Section VI details the research agenda for rigorous validation with larger samples and instrumental variables.

### Roadmap

The argument proceeds as follows:

**Section II** develops theoretical framework integrating Dennett's memetics, North's institutionalism, and Poli Gonzalvo's tacit consensus concept. I explain how unconscious cultural transmission creates institutional rigidity independent of formal barriers, why non-WEIRD contexts exhibit larger explicit-implicit preference gaps, and why polarization may coexist with deep consensus.

**Section III** operationalizes CLI_cultural, detailing measurement protocols for CT1 (LDA topic modeling), CT2 (BERT semantic distance), and CT3 (policy first-differencing). I acknowledge methodological limitations (CT3 circularity risk, small corpus size) and specify validation requirements for future work.

**Section IV** applies the framework comparatively. Starting with Chile (baseline: low lock-in, reforms possible) to establish comparison standard, proceeding to Argentina (extreme: high lock-in, reforms impossible) for dramatic contrast, concluding with Uruguay (intermediate: moderate lock-in, incremental reforms) to demonstrate gradient pattern. The Milei 2024 case in Box 1 provides preliminary validation that the framework can explain current events.

**Section V** discusses implications: the consensus-polarization paradox (high CLI_cultural predicts high polarization on non-core issues), differentiated reform strategies (direct institutional change vs. cultural erosion vs. incremental adaptation), and broader theoretical significance (when stated preferences diverge from behavioral constraints, which reflects "true" democratic will?).

**Section VI** concludes with acknowledged scope conditions, limitations requiring resolution (temporal separation, instrumental variables, larger n), and three-stage research agenda: (1) conceptual framework [this paper], (2) 5-country validation with strict identification (CAPA 2, $5-8K, 3-9 months), (3) 18-country expansion for top-tier journal publication (CAPA 3, $40-50K, 12-24 months).

This paper is the first step: establishing that tacit consensus is theoretically coherent, empirically measurable, and plausibly important. Definitive causal claims await fuller validation, but even at this conceptual stage, the framework offers a cautionary insight: reformers who ignore cultural lock-in are condemned to repeat Argentina's 33-year cycle of failure. As the Argentine case demonstrates, the most rigid institutions are not those protected by law, but those protected by silence—the consensus so deep that questioning it never enters political possibility.
