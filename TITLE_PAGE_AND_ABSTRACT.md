## ABSTRACT (200 words)

Institutional reform theories conventionally measure popular support through explicit preferences—surveys, electoral mandates, crisis urgency. Yet Argentina exhibits a paradox: 71% public support for labor flexibility reforms coexists with 0% reform success over 33 years (23 failed attempts, 1991-2024). This paper introduces **cultural lock-in** (CLI_cultural) as measurable constraint operating *below* conscious awareness, overriding stated preferences through tacit consensus.

I operationalize CLI_cultural via three behavioral indicators: (1) CT1 (narrative stability): discourse convergence across ideologically opposed governments, (2) CT2 (shock resistance): semantic invariance following exogenous crises, (3) CT3 (policy continuity): behavioral patterns unchanged despite electoral mandates. Comparative analysis of Argentina (CLI=0.809), Uruguay (0.676), and Chile (0.445) demonstrates CLI_cultural predicts reform capacity (r=0.98) far better than veto players, survey preferences, or economic crises.

The finding challenges WEIRD-developed theories that assume explicit-implicit preference alignment. In non-WEIRD contexts, implicit behavioral consensus systematically diverges from explicit stated preferences, producing institutional paralysis despite overwhelming reform support. I specify differentiated reform strategies calibrated to CLI_cultural levels: cultural erosion for high lock-in contexts (8-17 year timeline), incremental coalitions for moderate contexts, direct reform for low contexts.

**Future research:** Expansion to 18 countries, causal identification via instrumental variables, consensus-polarization hypothesis testing.

## EXTENDED ABSTRACT (500 words, for conference submissions)

### The Puzzle

Argentina presents an institutional paradox that confounds conventional reform theories. Latinobarómetro surveys (2015-2023) consistently show 71% public support for labor market flexibility reforms. Presidents across the ideological spectrum—from Peronist Carlos Menem (1989-1999) to center-right Mauricio Macri (2015-2019) to libertarian Javier Milei (2023-present)—won elections promising labor reform. Economic crises (2001-2002 collapse, 2018 peso crisis, 2024 hyperinflation) created urgent reform pressures. Yet labor law remains unchanged: 23 reform attempts over 33 years, zero legislative successes.

Conventional theories fail to explain this pattern. Veto player theory (Tsebelis 2002) predicts Argentina should have *moderate* rigidity (fewer veto points than Chile or Uruguay, where reforms succeeded). Electoral preference theory predicts Argentina should reform *most* easily (highest explicit support). Crisis theory (Drazen & Grilli 1993) predicts Argentina's severe shocks should unlock institutions (instead, 2001 crisis changed everything *except* labor law).

### Theoretical Contribution

I argue these theories miss the most powerful constraint: **cultural lock-in** operating through *implicit* (unconscious) mechanisms that override explicit preferences. Building on Dennett's (2017) memetic theory and North's (1990) institutional framework, I distinguish:

- **Explicit memetic capture:** Conscious attitudes measurable through surveys
- **Implicit memetic capture:** Unconscious behavioral patterns revealed through actions

In WEIRD contexts (Henrich 2020), explicit and implicit typically align, so surveys work. In non-WEIRD contexts (Latin America, Global South), they systematically diverge—producing Argentina's paradox (71% explicit support ≠ 0.71 implicit consensus → zero reforms).

### Measurement Innovation

I operationalize implicit cultural lock-in through **CLI_cultural index** combining three behavioral indicators:

1. **CT1 (Narrative Stability):** Correlation of presidential discourse across ideologically distinct governments (using LDA topic modeling on 300 speeches)
2. **CT2 (Shock Resistance):** Semantic distance pre/post exogenous crises (BERT embeddings measuring discourse adaptation speed)
3. **CT3 (Policy Continuity):** Correlation of objective policy indicators across partisan transitions (first-differenced data controlling for global trends)

Formula: CLI_cultural = 0.40·CT1 + 0.30·CT2 + 0.30·CT3

### Empirical Validation

Comparative analysis of three Southern Cone democracies (1990-2024):

| Country | CLI_cultural | Reform Success Rate | Pattern |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Argentina** | 0.809 (high) | 0% (0/23 attempts) | Complete paralysis |
| **Uruguay** | 0.676 (moderate) | 29% (4/14 attempts) | Selective reforms within consensus bounds |
| **Chile** | 0.445 (low) | 41% (7/17 attempts) | Reforms possible from left and right |

**Correlation:** CLI_cultural and reform failure rate: r = +0.98 (nearly perfect), far exceeding alternative explanations.

**Mechanism:** Argentine presidents across 34 years (Menem, Kirchner, Macri, Milei) unconsciously converge on identical labor discourse despite explicit ideological opposition—"acquired rights are irreversible," "social conquests are non-negotiable," "ultraactividad must be respected." This tacit consensus operates *below* awareness, making reform attempts "unthinkable" regardless of stated preferences.

### Policy Implications

CLI_cultural measurement enables diagnostic precision *before* investing political capital:

- **High lock-in (>0.75):** Frontal reform = guaranteed failure. Instead: 8-17 year cultural erosion strategy (education, subnational experiments, generational replacement)
- **Moderate lock-in (0.45-0.75):** Incremental reforms within consensus framework, compensatory measures, cross-partisan coalitions
- **Low lock-in (<0.45):** Direct institutional change via democratic mandates

President Milei's 2023-2024 trajectory validates theory: Libertarian outsider with 56% mandate nevertheless *behaviorally captured* by tacit consensus within one year—withdrawing labor reforms, negotiating with unions, adopting traditional "respecting acquired rights" discourse despite ideological opposition.

### Research Agenda

Future work will expand to N=18 countries (Latin America + Southern Europe + Eastern Europe), implement causal identification via historical instrumental variables (indigenous density 1500, colonial institutions), test consensus-polarization hypothesis (high CLI_cultural predicts polarization on *non-core* issues while maintaining consensus on core economic institutions), and conduct experimental interventions testing whether cultural lock-in can be deliberately eroded.

**Broader significance:** Institutional scholarship must move beyond WEIRD assumptions toward globally valid theories incorporating both explicit (survey-measured) and implicit (behaviorally-inferred) cultural constraints. The majority of world's population lives in contexts where formal-informal divergence is norm, not exception. CLI_cultural framework provides measurement tool for this previously invisible constraint.
